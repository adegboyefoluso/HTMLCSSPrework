    <div>
        <h2>Div One</h2>
        <p>This lopsum of a thing is quite strange to me .Whatever is it , i believe  it means something but not what i can explain.<br>
        It look like a complex language for the aliens with words that are very difficult to pronounce.It is not similar to anything known to humans.<br>
        I  will be very surprise if it is  a language for the humans. </p>
    </div>
    <div style="border:1px solid black;">
        <h2>Div Two</h2>
        <p>Back to this language of a thing. I need to find out , who discover this language and while is been used by programnmers as a test language.<br>
        It is majorly used in HTML. That raised a question, does it have anything to do with HTML or is part of HTML. While is it not been used in other languages.<br>
        If i sound primitive about this, please permit my curosity and  primitiveness , i just could not come to terms with why someone wil use something like that for trainig purpose
    </p>

    </div>
    <div style="background-color: gray;">
        <h2>Div three</h2>
        <p>This is getting interesting, Nobody has been able to answer my question concerning this strange language. Wait, dont you think it might have been a computer error in the past that was now adopted as a  standard in HML. <br>
        I will not stop until  i am able to unravel the mystery behind the language.Oh! i see, i just discover it might be some form of encryption or coding of message.But while will someone wnat to encrpt a message for training.Like i promise in the begining<br>
     of the expedition , i will find out what is fishing.</p>
